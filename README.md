BACteria in Mother Maching Analyzer (BACMMAN) is a software allowing fast and reliable automated image analysis of high-throughput 2D/3D time-series images from mother machine. Mother machine is a very popular microfluidic device allowing investigating biological processes in bacteria at the single-cell level.

This Software is in a process of publication, it will (hopefully) be soon available with a full documentation and test datasets. Please do not use it until then.
