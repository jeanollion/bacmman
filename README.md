BACteria in Mother Maching Analyzer (BACMMAN) is a software allowing fast and reliable automated image analysis of high-throughput 2D/3D time-series images from mother machine. Mother machine is a very popular microfluidic device allowing investigating biological processes in bacteria at the single-cell level.
