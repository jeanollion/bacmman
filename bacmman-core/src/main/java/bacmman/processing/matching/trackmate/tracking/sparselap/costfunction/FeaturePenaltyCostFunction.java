/**
 * SOURCE CODE TAKEN FROM TRACKMATE: https://github.com/fiji/TrackMate
 * A cost function that tempers a square distance cost by difference in feature
 * values.
 * <p>
 * This cost is calculated as follow:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The distance between the two spots <code>D</code> is calculated
 * <li>For each feature in the map, a penalty <code>p</code> is calculated as
 * <code>p = 3 × α × |f1-f2| / (f1+f2)</code>, where <code>α</code> is the
 * factor associated to the feature in the map. This expression is such that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>there is no penalty if the 2 feature values <code>f1</code> and
 * <code>f2</code> are the same;
 * <li>that, with a factor of 1, the penalty if 1 is one value is the double of
 * the other;
 * <li>the penalty is 2 if one is 5 times the other one.
 * </ul>
 * <li>All penalties are summed, to form <code>P = (1 + ∑ p )</code>
 * <li>The cost is set to the square of the product: <code>C = ( D × P )²</code>
 * </ul>
 * For instance: if 2 spots differ by twice the value in a feature which is in
 * the penalty map with a factor of 1, they will <i>look</i> as if they were
 * twice as far.
